# Kiro Development Logs

Kiro was used as an AI-powered development assistant throughout the project to accelerate development and reduce manual coding effort.

## How Kiro Helped

- Generated the initial HTML structure including headers, input forms, and result sections
- Suggested a clean and modern CSS layout suitable for a professional demo
- Provided JavaScript logic patterns for comparing options and explaining trade-offs
- Helped iterate quickly on UI improvements without rewriting code from scratch

## Manual Refinements

After generating the initial code using Kiro:
- The UI was refined for better spacing and readability
- Comparison data was customized to reflect realistic technology trade-offs
- Additional constraints such as performance were added
- Code was simplified to keep the project beginner-friendly and frontend-only

## Outcome

Using Kiro significantly reduced the time required to:
- Scaffold the application
- Design a clean UI
- Implement comparison logic

This allowed more focus on problem definition, decision logic, and user experience rather than boilerplate coding.
