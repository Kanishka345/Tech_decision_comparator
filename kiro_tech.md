# Tech Stack

## Core Technologies
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup with proper accessibility attributes
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with Grid and Flexbox layouts
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No frameworks or build tools required

## Architecture
- Single-page application (SPA) with static files
- Client-side only - no backend dependencies
- Data stored in JavaScript objects for comparison logic

## Browser Support
- Modern browsers supporting ES6+ features
- CSS Grid and Flexbox support required

## Development Workflow
This is a static web application that can be run directly in any web browser.

### Running the Application
```bash
# Simply open index.html in a web browser
# No build process or server required
```

### File Structure
- `index.html` - Main application entry point
- `script.js` - Application logic and comparison engine
- `style.css` - All styling and responsive design
- `README.md` - Project documentation

## Code Conventions
- Use semantic HTML elements
- CSS follows BEM-like naming where applicable
- JavaScript uses camelCase naming
- Functions are kept simple and focused on single responsibilities
